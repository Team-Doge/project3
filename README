The DNS project is for Systems and Networks at Northeastern University.

The project can be run by typing
./3600dns [-mx|-ns] @IP[:PORT] NAME

-mx     Optional    Look up mail server records
-ns     Optional    Look up name server records
IP      Required    The IP of the DNS server
PORT    Optional    The port number to connect on
NAME    Required    The name to look up


This project is entirely coded in C, and uses some starter code provided by
the professor, Alan Mislove. Each packet is manually constructed, with bits
manually set in the header and then broadcast over the network. Each response
is invididually looked at and broken apart to provide results to the user.


We began our approach by building packets up manually, by setting everything in the header and the
question ourselves. This was the simplest part. After getting a response, we took the different 
tasks of reading the header and answers and broke them into several different pieces. Our biggest
challenge was making sure we were getting the right offset in the data when dealing with mulitple
answers, and dealing with packet compression.

Overall, the part we like the most is separating the concerns, and having separate files for 
validation, extraction, etc. Having helper functions and breaking things down into smaller pieces
really made things easier to deal with.

We tested our code thoroughly by running it with many different examples and testing out what we
knew were good and bad domains/IPs.
