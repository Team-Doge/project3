The DNS project is for Systems and Networks at Northeastern University.

The project can be run by typing
./3600dns [-mx|-ns] @IP[:PORT] NAME

-mx     Optional    Look up mail server records
-ns     Optional    Look up name server records
IP      Required    The IP of the DNS server
PORT    Optional    The port number to connect on
NAME    Required    The name to look up


This project is entirely coded in C, and uses some starter code provided by
the professor, Alan Mislove. Each packet is manually constructed, with bits
manually set in the header and then broadcast over the network. Each response
is invididually looked at and broken apart to provide results to the user.


Things to include in our README before we submit:
1. Describe our high-level approach
2. Challenges we faced
3. List of properties/features of our design that we thought was good
4. Overview of how we tested our code
